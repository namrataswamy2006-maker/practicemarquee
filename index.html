        <h2><br> <hr>Bandra Fort</h2>
        <p><b>Bandra Fort (Castella de Aguada) was built by the Portuguese in 1640 as a strategic watchtower
            guarding the northern sea route into Mumbai Harbour, <br>overlooking Mahim Bay, and armed with cannons.<br>
            It passed from Portuguese to Maratha hands in 1739, then later to the British, who eventually dismantled parts,<br>
            with ruins restored today into a popular historical spot for sunsets and view.<br></b></p>
        <h2><br><hr>ISKCON</h2>
        <p><b>The ISKCON Temple in Mumbai, also known as Sri Radha Rasabihari ji Temple, is a famous Hindu temple dedicated 
            to Lord Krishna in Juhu, <br>offering spiritual solace, cultural events, and vegetarian food at its Govinda's restaurant,
             open daily with specific morning/evening darshan timings,<br> free entry, and a calm atmosphere near Juhu Beach. </b></p>
        <h2><br><hr> Gateway Of India</h2>
        <p><b>The Gateway of India was built by the British in Mumbai to commemorate King George V and Queen Mary's 1911 visit 
            symbolizing India's 'gateway' <br>during colonial rule, designed by George Wittet in Indo-Saracenic style, 
            with its foundation laid in 1913 and completion in 1924, <br>
            later becoming a significant site for the final departure of British troops in 1948, marking India's independence.</b></p>
